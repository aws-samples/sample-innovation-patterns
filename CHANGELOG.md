## [0.1.7]

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- N/A

### Fixed
- **`/ipa-compose` deploy→deploy wiring** — `MAKEFILE_TEMPLATES.md` now splits deploy.mk wiring rules by source-stack lifecycle. Prepare-source wiring continues to read from `.env` via `$(VAR)`; deploy-source wiring captures values via `$(eval ... describe-stacks ...)` at the top of the target body, stored as `{VAR}_LIVE`. Make parses `-include .env` once at process startup, so values that env.mk writes to `.env` mid-run are invisible to subsequent targets in the same `make deploy` invocation. The previous single-rule template produced an empty `SqsSendQueueArns` for `deploy-backend`, causing `LambdaExecutionRole` `CREATE_FAILED` on IAM ("Resource must be in ARN format or '*'"). The `ipa-stack-backend` skill now flags `SqsQueueUrl`/`SqsSendQueueArns` as same-lifecycle wiring per Case B.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Conventional Commits convention** — adopted [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages, with type/scope/breaking-change rules documented in `CLAUDE.md` and a public reference at `developer-docs/contributing/commit-messages.md`.
- **CHANGELOG automation via git-cliff** — added `cliff.toml` mapping conventional commit types to Keep-a-Changelog sections, plus a `release-changelog` Make target that regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` from commit history. Run `make -f scripts/util/release.mk release-prep VERSION=X.Y.Z` to stamp VERSION and produce a CHANGELOG draft in one step.
- **Manual `Tag & Release` trigger** — GitLab CI release job is now a manual play button on `main` pipelines instead of auto-firing on every VERSION-bump merge. The builder decides when to release; `release-check.sh` still validates VERSION ↔ tag at runtime.

### Changed

- **Trunk-based development on `main`** — the project moves from the develop → main merge-based release flow to trunk-based development on `main`. Daily work lands on `main` directly or via short-lived feature branches. Eliminates the SHA-reconciliation merges that were required to keep `develop` and `main` aligned.
- **`scripts/env.mk` is now the canonical bridge between live CloudFormation stack outputs and the Make system.** Every consumer (`deploy.mk`, `post-deploy.mk`, local dev server) reads values from `.env`; only env.mk calls `aws cloudformation describe-stacks`. CodeBuild stages run env.mk as a prelude to populate `.env` before each stage's main target. Stack outputs are no longer baked into CodeBuild EnvironmentVariables, where they could go stale and silently override live values via Make's environment-precedence rule. Generated Makefiles drop all inline `$(eval ... describe-stacks ...)` from deploy and post-deploy targets — only env.mk and prepare.mk (the bootstrap) keep them.
- **web-client build tooling** — replaced `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` with `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel-based) to eliminate platform-specific `@swc/core` binaries from the dependency tree. This fixes CodeBuild `npm ci` failures when `package-lock.json` is generated on macOS but CI runs on Linux. No application code changes; build, tests, and dev server verified.

### Fixed

- **web-client cross-platform lockfile** — regenerated `web-client/package-lock.json` to include both Linux x64 and macOS arm64 entries for native packages (`@rollup/rollup-*`, `@esbuild/*`, `@tailwindcss/oxide-*`, `lightningcss-*`). The prior swc fix only addressed swc binaries; CodeBuild `npm ci` was still failing on missing Linux variants for tailwind v4, esbuild, rollup, and lightningcss. Verified with `npm ci --os=linux --cpu=x64` and local `npm run build`.
- **Innovation Builder Security stack** — added `cloudwatch:*` to the Infrastructure allow block of `InnovationBuilderPolicy`. Tier stacks declaring `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm` or `AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard` (queue, backend) previously failed during deploy with `cloudwatch:PutDashboard`/`cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm` AccessDenied. The destructive subset (`DeleteAlarms`, `DeleteDashboards`, `DisableAlarmActions`) remains denied by the existing `SecureLoggingConfigs` deny block in both the boundary and identity policy.
- **`update-cognito-callback` parameter drift** — the post-deploy step now reads `COGNITO_DOMAIN_PREFIX` from `.env` (populated by `env.mk` from the live `CognitoDomain` stack output) instead of recomputing it as `$(APP_NAMESPACE)-$(APP_ENV)-$(APP_ACCOUNT_HASH)`. The recomputed value could differ from the deployed parameter (different `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, different `.env` across hosts, etc.), which CFN treated as a property change → REPLACE on `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolDomain` → live domain destroyed mid-update. Reading the deployed value eliminates the drift.
- **Frontend deploy `LogBucketDomainName` empty in CodeBuild** — `deploy-frontend` previously read `$(LOG_BUCKET_NAME)` directly from `.env`, but `.env` did not exist in CodeBuild and the variable was not in the CodeBuild EnvironmentVariables. The empty value produced `LogBucketDomainName=.s3.amazonaws.com`, causing `WebBucket` to fail with "The specified bucket is not valid." Now generalized via the env.mk refactor — every deploy stage's prelude populates `.env` from live stack state.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- N/A

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline** — combined `auto-tag` and `github-release` into a single `auto-tag-and-release` job. Separate jobs were unreliable because `CI_JOB_TOKEN`-authenticated tag pushes do not trigger follow-up pipelines, so the tag-driven release job never fired. Trade-off: manually pushed tags no longer trigger a GitHub release.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **`/ipa-stack-logs`** — new prepare-lifecycle stack for a centralized S3 log bucket (CloudFront, S3 access, VPC flow logs). Composed via `/ipa-compose` and auto-included as a transitive dependency when a downstream stack wires `LogBucketName`. Generates `update-env-logs` env.mk target and a `prepare.mk` teardown note for non-empty buckets.

### Changed

- **`/ipa-security`** — log bucket extracted from the security stack into the new `/ipa-stack-logs` prepare stack. `/ipa-security` now provisions only IAM roles (one CloudFormation stack instead of two). The frontend tier's `LogBucketDomainName` parameter now sources from `logs` instead of `security`.
- **`/ipa-compose`** — recursive auto-include now resolves `logs` alongside `cognito`/`ecr`/`codecommit`. Generated deploy targets that reference `$(LOG_BUCKET_NAME)` now emit a pre-check that validates the `{ns}-{env}-logs` stack exists before deploying.

### Fixed

- **Docs site** — Docusaurus `baseUrl` now derives from `CI_PAGES_URL` so the GitLab Pages deploy tracks the project slug instead of a hardcoded path.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- **Compose CodePipeline** — integrated `codecommit` and `codepipeline` as composable prepare-lifecycle stacks in `/ipa-compose`. Added `## Stack Identity`, `## Wirable Parameters`, `## Compose Config`, and `## Deploy Order` to both stack skills. Compose auto-includes `codecommit` as a transitive dependency of `codepipeline`, prompts for repository name and source branch, and generates `prepare.mk` targets with full cross-stack wiring. Added `update-env-pipeline` target to env.mk generation.

### Deprecated

- **`/ipa-codepipeline`** — replaced with the standard compose+prepare flow (`/ipa-compose codepipeline` → `/ipa-prepare`). Existing deployments are compatible; re-compose to align.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **Lifecycle refactor** — collapsed 5-skill lifecycle into 4-step flow: `/ipa-init` → `/ipa-compose` → `/ipa-prepare` → `/ipa-deploy`. `/ipa-security` is now embedded in `/ipa-compose` (triggered on first compose) and supports three paths: existing role ARN, managed policy, or the new Innovation Builder Stack (recommended — permissions boundary + 47-service policy + four scoped roles). `/ipa-compose` auto-runs `/ipa-init` when `.env` is missing; `/ipa-deploy` hard-gates on prepare stacks instead of auto-triggering. Split `infra/cfn/generated/security.yml` into `iam.yml` + `log-bucket.yml`.
- **Skill naming** — renamed all `ipa.*` skills to use `-` as the separator instead of `.` (e.g., `/ipa.compose` → `/ipa-compose`, `/ipa.stack.backend` → `/ipa-stack-backend`). Affects 17 skill directories, frontmatter, internal references, and all published documentation.

### Added

- **`/ipa-help`** — new diagnostic skill that reports IPA project state and suggests the next lifecycle skill to run. Read-only; does not invoke other skills.
- **Innovation Builder Security stack** — new single-template CloudFormation stack at `infra/cfn/security/innovation-builder-security.yml` consolidating the IAM policy + permissions boundary, CodeBuild role, SageMaker execution role, builder role, and EC2 builder role into one deployable artifact. Consumed as-is by `/ipa-security`; deploy this OR the per-resource templates, not both.
- **`/ipa-security` skill** — full implementation supporting three setup paths (existing role ARN, AWS managed policy, or the Innovation Builder Stack), with deploy/update/review flows, `.env` wiring for `DEPLOYMENT_ROLE_ARN`/`PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY_ARN`, and stack drift handling.

### Removed

- **`/ipa-quickstart`** — removed; the 4-step lifecycle is the new quickstart.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **Docs site** — GitHub Pages now deploys on pushes to `main` instead of release tags, matching the existing GitLab Pages trigger and avoiding the `github-pages` environment protection rule that blocks tag-based deploys.

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline** — `github-push.sh` now sets a local committer identity before amending the filtered release commit, preventing `fatal: unable to auto-detect email address` in CI.
- **Release pipeline** — after amending the release commit to strip internal-only paths, the release tag is now moved to the amended commit so GitHub's tag, `main`, and auto-generated release tarball all reference the same filtered tree.
- **Auto-tag** — rule no longer excludes `$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"`, which was blocking the job from ever firing on a standard push-to-main. Tag existence now checked against `origin` to tolerate CI's shallow clone.
