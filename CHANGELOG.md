All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- N/A

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline** — combined `auto-tag` and `github-release` into a single `auto-tag-and-release` job. Separate jobs were unreliable because `CI_JOB_TOKEN`-authenticated tag pushes do not trigger follow-up pipelines, so the tag-driven release job never fired. Trade-off: manually pushed tags no longer trigger a GitHub release.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **`/ipa-stack-logs`** — new prepare-lifecycle stack for a centralized S3 log bucket (CloudFront, S3 access, VPC flow logs). Composed via `/ipa-compose` and auto-included as a transitive dependency when a downstream stack wires `LogBucketName`. Generates `update-env-logs` env.mk target and a `prepare.mk` teardown note for non-empty buckets.

### Changed

- **`/ipa-security`** — log bucket extracted from the security stack into the new `/ipa-stack-logs` prepare stack. `/ipa-security` now provisions only IAM roles (one CloudFormation stack instead of two). The frontend tier's `LogBucketDomainName` parameter now sources from `logs` instead of `security`.
- **`/ipa-compose`** — recursive auto-include now resolves `logs` alongside `cognito`/`ecr`/`codecommit`. Generated deploy targets that reference `$(LOG_BUCKET_NAME)` now emit a pre-check that validates the `{ns}-{env}-logs` stack exists before deploying.

### Fixed

- **Docs site** — Docusaurus `baseUrl` now derives from `CI_PAGES_URL` so the GitLab Pages deploy tracks the project slug instead of a hardcoded path.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- **Compose CodePipeline** — integrated `codecommit` and `codepipeline` as composable prepare-lifecycle stacks in `/ipa-compose`. Added `## Stack Identity`, `## Wirable Parameters`, `## Compose Config`, and `## Deploy Order` to both stack skills. Compose auto-includes `codecommit` as a transitive dependency of `codepipeline`, prompts for repository name and source branch, and generates `prepare.mk` targets with full cross-stack wiring. Added `update-env-pipeline` target to env.mk generation.

### Deprecated

- **`/ipa-codepipeline`** — replaced with the standard compose+prepare flow (`/ipa-compose codepipeline` → `/ipa-prepare`). Existing deployments are compatible; re-compose to align.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **Lifecycle refactor** — collapsed 5-skill lifecycle into 4-step flow: `/ipa-init` → `/ipa-compose` → `/ipa-prepare` → `/ipa-deploy`. `/ipa-security` is now embedded in `/ipa-compose` (triggered on first compose) and supports three paths: existing role ARN, managed policy, or the new Innovation Builder Stack (recommended — permissions boundary + 47-service policy + four scoped roles). `/ipa-compose` auto-runs `/ipa-init` when `.env` is missing; `/ipa-deploy` hard-gates on prepare stacks instead of auto-triggering. Split `infra/cfn/generated/security.yml` into `iam.yml` + `log-bucket.yml`.
- **Skill naming** — renamed all `ipa.*` skills to use `-` as the separator instead of `.` (e.g., `/ipa.compose` → `/ipa-compose`, `/ipa.stack.backend` → `/ipa-stack-backend`). Affects 17 skill directories, frontmatter, internal references, and all published documentation.

### Added

- **`/ipa-help`** — new diagnostic skill that reports IPA project state and suggests the next lifecycle skill to run. Read-only; does not invoke other skills.
- **Innovation Builder Security stack** — new single-template CloudFormation stack at `infra/cfn/security/innovation-builder-security.yml` consolidating the IAM policy + permissions boundary, CodeBuild role, SageMaker execution role, builder role, and EC2 builder role into one deployable artifact. Consumed as-is by `/ipa-security`; deploy this OR the per-resource templates, not both.
- **`/ipa-security` skill** — full implementation supporting three setup paths (existing role ARN, AWS managed policy, or the Innovation Builder Stack), with deploy/update/review flows, `.env` wiring for `DEPLOYMENT_ROLE_ARN`/`PERMISSIONS_BOUNDARY_ARN`, and stack drift handling.

### Removed

- **`/ipa-quickstart`** — removed; the 4-step lifecycle is the new quickstart.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **Docs site** — GitHub Pages now deploys on pushes to `main` instead of release tags, matching the existing GitLab Pages trigger and avoiding the `github-pages` environment protection rule that blocks tag-based deploys.

### Fixed

- **Release pipeline** — `github-push.sh` now sets a local committer identity before amending the filtered release commit, preventing `fatal: unable to auto-detect email address` in CI.
- **Release pipeline** — after amending the release commit to strip internal-only paths, the release tag is now moved to the amended commit so GitHub's tag, `main`, and auto-generated release tarball all reference the same filtered tree.
- **Auto-tag** — rule no longer excludes `$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"`, which was blocking the job from ever firing on a standard push-to-main. Tag existence now checked against `origin` to tolerate CI's shallow clone.
